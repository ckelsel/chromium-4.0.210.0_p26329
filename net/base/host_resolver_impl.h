// For each hostname that is requested, HostResolver creates a
// HostResolverImpl::Job. This job gets dispatched to a thread in the global
// WorkerPool, where it runs SystemHostResolverProc(). If requests for that same
// host are made while the job is already outstanding, then they are attached
// to the existing job rather than creating a new one. This avoids doing
// parallel resolves for the same host.
//
// The way these classes fit together is illustrated by:
//
