// deviation of the histograms because they are meaningless.

// We use two groups of counters.  In the first group (counter1), each counter
// is a boolean (0 or 1) that indicates whether the user has seen an FTP server
// of that type during that session.  In the second group (counter2), each
// counter is the number of transactions with FTP server of that type the user
// has made during that session.
//
// Each histogram has an unused bucket at the end to allow seamless future
